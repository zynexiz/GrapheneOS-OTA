## GrapheneOS OTA update script for rooted firmware

Simple update script for bash to flash OTA updates for GrapheneOS. This update script is **only** for devices using root and Magisk! If your firmware isn't rooted use the built in OTA update shiped with GrapheneOS.

Note that you need to follow the guide how to sign the bootloader with your own keys and apply those steps first. This is **only** for OTA updates! Also don't forget to disable the built in OTA in GrapheneOS, else you might break everything. To turn off the update client, go to Settings âž” Apps, enabling Show system via the menu and selecting **System Update**. Then disable the app.

For more information about locking the bootloader with Magisk and root, check the guide on XDA  https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-to-lock-bootloader-while-using-rooted-grapheneos-magisk-root.4510295/

## First steps
Create the directories **ota** and **keys** somewhere. Edit the script and change the OTA, KEYS and MAGISK strings in the script to the right path (use absoulute path).
Make sure you have avbroot binary, if not download it from https://github.com/chenxiaolong/avbroot, or if using Arch Linux install it from AUR.

Put your custom keys you used to sign the bootloader within the keys directory.
Download the latest OTA firmware from GrapheneOS website and put it in the ota directory.
Downoad latest version of magisk and save it somewhere (preferably the same folder as you have ota and keys folder).
Make sure to make the script executable with **chmod u+x ota_update**.

## Usage
Turn on ADB debugging in Developer Options and run the script. Connect your phone to the computer with an USB-cable.
Run the script and select the OTA firmware you want to flash. The script will sign the image with your keys, patch it with Magisk, and then reboot the phone and flash the OTA. Wait until the process is done. The phone will then reboot.
